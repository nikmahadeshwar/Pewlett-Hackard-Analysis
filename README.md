# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the Retirement Titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. We are using DISTINCT ON statement as some employees have multiple titles in the database because of promotions so we are creating a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. We have also used the COUNT() function to create a that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.

## Results: 
* Retirment titles table helps to see the future retirement employee and how they growed within the company.

* The unique titles table shows the most recent title for employees of retirment age.

## Retiring Titles:

Retiring Titles shows us that a majority of the employees of retirment age that is around 64% have senior titles.

## Summary:

We can summarize that around 64% of the workforce is going to the stage of retirement or mentorship eligibility. There will be many future open positions that need to be filled over the next 5-10 years. The company may have to soon look out for more hiring so that they can have the replacement ready before the employees retire. Hiring should be done on the basis of experience to fill the gaps of the future reitrement employees. The best strategy would be to make sure the knowledge articles and the experiences of senior employees have been recorded that led to their successful careers and growth of the company. Also the companies can hire new interns or recent graduates from the universities so that they would stick to the company for longer time. The company should also focus on growth within the company.
